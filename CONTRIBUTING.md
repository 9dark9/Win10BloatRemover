# Contributing guidelines
- Open an issue before starting to implement a feature, so that it can be discussed and approved/rejected before you work on it (we don't want to waste contributors' time)
- Create new branches for your work. Make a pull request on an existing branch only to fix very specific bugs that can't be ported over other branches
- Always allow edits from maintainers on your pull requests
- Keep your code as clean as possible, and use comments to explain anything that it may not seem obvious to other devs
- Please follow strictly these styling guidelines:
  - Place brackets on the next line, except for enums and array/dictionary initializers
  - Do not use brackets for one-line code blocks (unless they are mandatory, e.g. try/catch blocks)
  - Follow [Microsoft .NET guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines) for variables naming
