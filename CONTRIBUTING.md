# Contributing guidelines
- Open an issue before starting to implement a feature, so that it can be discussed and approved/rejected before you work on it (we don't want to waste contributors' time)
- Arrange your work so that it can be easily ported over multiple branches (usually two branches are maintained at the same time)
- Always allow edits from maintainers on your pull requests
- Keep your code as clean as possible by following these tips:
  - a long but descriptive function/variable name is better than a concise but unclear one
  - keep functions short (try to keep an average of 5-10 lines, don't go over 20 unless necessary)
  - avoid code duplication
  - use comments only if you can't explain it with code
- Please follow strictly these styling guidelines:
  - Place brackets on the next line, except for anonymous functions and array/dictionary/class initializers
  - Do not use brackets for one-line code blocks (unless they are mandatory, e.g. try/catch blocks)
  - Follow [Microsoft .NET guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines) for variables naming
