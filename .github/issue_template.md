Hi!
Thanks for taking the time to write an issue.

Before starting, if you want to:
- ask a question about the tool
- share an idea of a feature you would like to see implemented

then **open a new discussion** by going to "Discussions" at the top of the page -> "New discussion".
This helps us to keep Issues focused just on bugs and things that need to be improved. Thanks!


Still here? So you want to report a problem you have with the program.
In your description of the problem, don't forget to include these things:
- Windows version
- Program version
- Edition of Windows you are running the program on (Home, Pro, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable)

You can delete this introductory text when you are done.
Thank you!
